                    <p>And thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing ripped up and drawn as lineally
                        as any pedigree. We have it not, that can be heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or
                        church; nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor from the modern custom
                        of any reformed city or church abroad, but from the most anti-christian council and the most
                        tyrannous inquisition that ever inquired.</p>
                    <p> Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the
                        brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the
                        nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who denies, but that
                        it was justly burnt, or sunk into the sea? </p>
                    <p>But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before a jury ere it
                        be born to the world, and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues,
                        ere it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious
                        iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and
                        new hells wherein they might include our books also within the number of their damned. And this
                        was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our
                        inquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye like not now these
                        most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all sinister intention was far distant
                        from your thoughts, when ye were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of
                        your actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.</p>

                    <p>They are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to remove sin by removing the
                        matter of sin; for, besides that it is a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing,
                        though some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot from all, in
                        such a universal thing as books are; and when this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though
                        ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye cannot bereave him
                        of his covetousness.</p>
                    <p> Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised
                        in any hermitage, ye cannot make them chaste, that came not hither so; such great care and
                        wisdom is required to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could expel sin by this
                        means; look how much we thus expel of sin, so much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them
                        both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike.</p>

                        prelates and their chaplains with the goodly echo they made; and besotted us to the gay
                        imitation of a lordly Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, another from the west end of Paul's.
                    </p>
                    <p>So apishly Romanizing, that the word of command still was set down in Latin; as if the learned

                        because no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as
                        I hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements
                        of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption
                        English.</p> <img src="4.8bd42ed5.jpg" alt="Some image">
                    <p>And it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive, and most injurious to the written
                        labours and monuments of the dead, so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole
                        nation. I cannot set so light by all the invention, the art, the wit, the grave and solid
                        judgment which is in England, as that it can be comprehended in any twenty capacities how good
                        soever, much less that it should not pass except their superintendence be over it, except it be
                        sifted and strained with their strainers, that it should be uncurrent without their manual
                        stamp. </p>
                    <p>Truth and understanding are not such wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and
                        statutes and standards. We must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the
                        land, to mark and licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks. What is it but a servitude
                        like that imposed by the Philistines, not to be allowed the sharpening of our own axes and
                        coulters, but we must repair from all quarters to twenty licensing forges? </p>
                    <p>Had anyone written and divulged erroneous things and scandalous to honest life, misusing and
                        forfeiting the esteem had of his reason among men, if after conviction this only censure were
                        adjudged him that he should never henceforth write but what were first examined by an appointed
                        officer, whose hand should be annexed to pass his credit for him that now he might be safely
                        read; it could not be apprehended less than a disgraceful punishment. Whence to include the
                        whole nation, and those that never yet thus offended, under such a diffident and suspectful
                        prohibition, may plainly be understood what a disparagement it is. So much the more, whenas
                        debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must not stir
                        forth without a visible jailer in their title.</p>

                    <p>And in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our ministers also, of whose labours we should
                        hope better, and of the proficiency which their flock reaps by them, than that after all this
                        light of the Gospel which is, and is to be, and all this continual preaching, they should still
                        be frequented with such an unprincipled, unedified and laic rabble, as that the whiff of every
                        new pamphlet should stagger them out of their catechism and Christian walking. </p>
                    <p>This may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their
                        exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turned
                        loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all the sermons, all the lectures
                        preached, printed, vented in such numbers, and such volumes, as have now well nigh made all
                        other books unsaleable, should not be armour enough against one single Enchiridion, without the
                        castle of St. Angelo of an Imprimatur.</p>

                        prelates and their chaplains with the goodly echo they made; and besotted us to the gay
                        imitation of a lordly Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, another from the west end of Paul's.
                    </p>
                    <p> So apishly Romanizing, that the word of command still was set down in Latin; as if the learned
                        grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no ink without Latin; or perhaps, as they thought,
                        because no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as
                        I hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements
                        of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption
                        English.</p> <img src="6.924e64bf.jpg" alt="Some image">
                    <p>Next, what more national corruption, for which England hears ill abroad, than household gluttony:
                        who shall be the rectors of our daily rioting? And what shall be done to inhibit the multitudes
                        that frequent those houses where drunkenness is sold and harboured? Our garments also should be
                        referred to the licensing of some more sober workmasters to see them cut into a less wanton
                        garb. </p>
                    <p>Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the
                        fashion of this country? Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what presumed, and no
                        further? Lastly, who shall forbid and separate all idle resort, all evil company? These things
                        will be, and must be; but how they shall be least hurtful, how least enticing, herein consists
                        the grave and governing wisdom of a state.</p>
